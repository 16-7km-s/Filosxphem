# Filos*phem

**Filos*phem** is a **minimal, experimental** programming language implemented as an interpreter. The name is a condensed version of its original designation, "Forth/Lisp-like 'Hemlock' Script", reflecting its core influences:

*   **`Filo`**: Represents the **FILO (First-In-Last-Out) stack**, a core concept borrowed from **Forth**
*   **`los*p`**: Draws inspiration from **S-expressions** in **Lisp** (the `*` bridges to "philosophem", see below)
*   **`hem`**: References **"Hemlock"**, an **internal nickname** for this project (not related to any existing language)

The name evolved as:  
`Forth/Lisp-like 'Hemlock' Script` -> `Folisphem` -> `Filos*phem`

This is a **learning project** as my personal exploration into interpreter development while learning fundamental computer science concepts.
